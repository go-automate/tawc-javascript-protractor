Have had to change the edit data to include the edit data in the same object as the product.

Need async / awaits for the checks.

Terrible errors: JavascriptError: javascript error: Cannot read property 'indexOf' of null - test data variable was empty

Stack trace no help

Debugging software no help - random!

Seemed to have an undefined 

Clone and do npm install


TO DO:

1. Surround asyncs with try/catches
2. Add data
2. Add documentation and comments
3. Write README
4. Score this badboy
5. Move browser.get to beforeall
